# PointNet
Implementation of PointNet by Pytorch. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)

This is the explanation of PointNet as I wrote.

To check varidity of PointNet, I experiment the 2 classification task.

One data is sampled from uniform distribution and other is sampled from normal distribution as 3D data.

In this experiment, PoinNet has high performance.
